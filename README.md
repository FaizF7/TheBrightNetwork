### The MVP

The purpose of the application is to faciliate learning and networking of BNTA coursemates via the following:

1. Enable BNTA trainers to create chatrooms for individual study groups and assign users to these rooms
2. Enable users to create their own study groups over the Winter Break
3. Enable users to create code challenge groups to study/work towards hackathons and codewars.
4. Enable current users to connect with BNTA graduates/consultants i.e. an alumni networking service

### Key Functionalities

Our program has the following main functionalities:

* Allow for the creation of a new user
* Allow you to update the information of a user
* Delete a user from the database
* Allow a user to post a message in a chatroom
* Allow a user to update their message
* Allow users to read messages sent by other users in a chatroom, most recent first
* Allow users to create a chatroom dependent on it having two members
* Allow a new user to be added to an existing chatroom (via creating a new subscription for the user to the chatroom)
* Delete a subscription (removing user from chatroom)
* Display all existing chatrooms
* Display all users in a specific chatroom


### Dependencies

* For posting a message: need to ensure user is in the chatroom first, before allowing them to post
* A user can not read all the messages in a chatroom if they are not a part of that chatroom.


### Extensions

There are a few functionalities which would really add to the program but are not necessary for the running and execution of the program:

- Allow user to search a message within a chatroom by keyword
- Allow user to search a message across all chatrooms by keyword
- Allow users to react to a message
